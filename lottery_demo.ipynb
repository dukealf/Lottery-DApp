    "## Decentralized Lottery App on the Ethereum Blockchain\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview:\n",
    "This is a demo for a simple lottery Dapp. The traditional lottery system is inherently unfair to players. Winnings are lost due to splitting pots, paying taxes, and fraud. This app allows players to join a lottery for the cost of 1 ether. Each address can only enter the lottery once. The winner is randomly selected and recieves the entire payout. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Process:\n",
    "-the owner of the contract opens the lottery \n",
    "-players can enter the lottery by sending 1 ether\n",
    "-the ether is pooled together\n",
    "-the owner closes the lottery and calls a function to randomly select a winner\n",
    "-the winner and payout is visible to all\n",
    "-the winning address recieves the payout\n",
    "-the owner can reset the lottery and the process can begin again\n",
    "\n",
    "### Contracts:\n",
    "There is one Solidity contract called Lottery.sol. This contains all necessary information to successfully conduct the lottery. This can be found in the contracts folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Demo:\n",
    "Run the cells in order and follow comments. The blockchain I use to deploy and test the contract is [eth-tester](https://github.com/ethereum/eth-tester). This supports the PyEVM backend, which is a full Ethereum implementation in Python. I interact with PyEVM using Web3. Eth-tester will automatically be set to interact with PyEVM.\n",

    "### How to address randomness:\n",
    "100% true randomness in Ethereum is almost impossible to achieve since everything is deterministic. The most effective solutions are to use oracles or generate random numbers off chain. A solution such as Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) is provable random, but I decided not to pursue this because I would need to send LINK to generate a number this way. Instead, I have a solution that could potentially be exploited by the miner, but it would be pretty difficult. The owner closes the lottery so no one else can enter. Then, the owner calls a function to generate a winner. The random number is generated from the hash of the block.timestamp + block.difficulty. Since the players do not know when the owner will call the function to choose a winner and the players cannot predict the exact timestamps of future blocks, this solution should be mostly fair. Potential problems come from miners manipulating the timestamp and difficulty to get a hash they are looking for. But if they are waiting for a specific time or difficulty, someone else will hash the block before them. Overall, I think this is a solid method for this scenario, but certainly should not be used on the real blockchain.\n",

    "### Challenges:\n",
    "Initially, I hoped to deploy the contract to the Rinkby testnet using Infura, but I would have had to create numerous Metamask accounts in order to interact with the lottery contract. I also wanted to build a \"Can't-Lose Lottery\" where the pooled lottery money is used to generate interest which is sent to a winner and everyone else gets their initial investment back. However, I could not efficiently simulate the process of generating interest on the pooled ether. \n",
